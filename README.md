# The Royal Game of Ur
![Game Setup](/docs/ur-start.png)
Ur is supposedly the oldest playable board game we know of. This implementation uses processing, a java library to easily draw graphics, to play the game on their own computers. The rules were based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I) by *The British Museum*. The goal of this project was to learn and develop techniques for implementing board game mechanics into a video game, as well as to make a game accessable that otherwise is near impossible to play.
A picture of the game in progress is below:
